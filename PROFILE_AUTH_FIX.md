# Profile Page Authentication Fix

## Problem
Clicking "View Profile" was redirecting to the sign-in page because the profile endpoint now requires authentication.

## Solution
Updated the ProfilePage component to work with the new authenticated API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### ProfilePage.tsx Updates

1. **Removed localStorage dependency**:
   - No longer uses `studentId` from localStorage
   - Uses authenticated user from `useAuth` context

2. **Updated hooks**:
   - Changed from `useGetProfileWithStats(studentId)` to `useGetProfileWithStats()`
   - Backend automatically gets student_id from auth token

3. **Simplified profile management**:
   - Removed "Switch Profile" button (one user = one profile)
   - Profile automatically linked to logged-in user
   - Create profile uses user's email and name from auth

4. **Updated styling**:
   - Changed to black and gold theme
   - Matches login/signup pages
   - Better visual consistency

## How It Works Now

### First Time User
1. User signs up and logs in
2. Visits profile page
3. Sees "Create Your Profile" screen
4. Fills in learning preferences
5. Profile created and linked to their account

### Returning User
1. User logs in
2. Visits profile page
3. Sees their profile with statistics
4. Can edit profile information

### Profile Data
- Automatically linked to authenticated user
- No manual student_id management
- Secure - users can only see/edit their own profile

## Testing

### Test Profile Creation
```bash
1. Sign up as new user
2. Go to Profile page
3. Should see "Create Your Profile" screen
4. Fill in details and submit
5. Should see profile with stats
```

### Test Profile Viewing
```bash
1. Login as existing user
2. Go to Profile page
3. Should see profile immediately
4. No redirect to login
```

### Test Profile Editing
```bash
1. View your profile
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Update information
4. Save changes
5. Should see updated profile
```

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` - Complete rewrite for auth
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProfile.ts` - Updated endpoints (already done)

## Key Improvements

1. **Security**: Profile data tied to authenticated user
2. **Simplicity**: No manual ID management
3. **UX**: Cleaner flow for new users
4. **Consistency**: Matches app theme and auth flow

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/profile` - Get current user's profile
- `GET /api/profile/stats` - Get profile with statistics
- `POST /api/profile` - Create profile for current user
- `PUT /api/profile` - Update current user's profile

All endpoints automatically use the authenticated user's student_id from the auth token.

## Troubleshooting

### Still redirecting to login
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify token in localStorage (key: 'user')

### Profile not loading
- Check backend is running
- Verify auth token is valid
- Try logout and login again

### Can't create profile
- Check all required fields are filled
- Verify backend connection
- Check browser console for errors
