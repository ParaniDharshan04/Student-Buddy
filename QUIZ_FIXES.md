# Quiz Fixes - Complete!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Don't Show Uploaded Content
**Problem:** When uploading a file for quiz, the entire content was displayed
**Solution:** Now only shows the filename, not the content

**Before:**
```
Topic: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit..."
(Shows entire document content)
```

**After:**
```
Topic: "document.pdf"
(Shows only filename)
```

### 2. ✅ Quiz Attempts Now Tracked
**Problem:** Profile showed 0 quizzes taken even after completing quizzes
**Solution:** Added quiz submission to backend when quiz is completed

**What Happens Now:**
1. Generate quiz
2. Answer all questions
3. Click "Finish Quiz"
4. **Quiz automatically submitted to backend**
5. **Profile statistics update**
6. Shows in "Quizzes Taken" count

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes:

**1. QuizPage.tsx**
- ✅ Changed to show only filename instead of content
- ✅ Content still used for quiz generation (hidden from user)

**2. QuizDisplay.tsx**
- ✅ Added quiz submission on completion
- ✅ Tracks time taken
- ✅ Submits answers to backend
- ✅ Updates profile statistics

**3. useQuiz.ts Hook**
- ✅ Added `useSubmitQuiz` hook

- ✅ Updates profile statistics

## How It Works Now

6. **Profile updates** → Statistics refresh

### What Gets Tracked:
