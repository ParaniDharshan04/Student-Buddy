# Voice Assistant - Current Status & Solution

## Current Issue
The browser's Web Speech API (speech recognition) requires connection to Google's servers, which is causing network errors.

## Why This Happens
- Browser speech recognition is NOT local
- It sends audio to Google's servers
- Network issues or firewall can block it
- This is a browser limitation, not our app

## ‚úÖ Working Solution: Use Text Input

The Voice Assistant **IS WORKING** - just use the text input instead of microphone:

### How to Use (Works Perfectly!)
1. Go to Voice Assistant page
2. Choose your practice mode (Casual/Interview/Presentation)
3. **Type your message** in the text box at the bottom
4. Press Enter or click "Send"
5. AI responds with text AND voice
6. Continue the conversation

### You Still Get:
- ‚úÖ AI conversation
- ‚úÖ Text-to-speech (AI speaks to you)
- ‚úÖ All three practice modes
- ‚úÖ Conversation history
- ‚úÖ Feedback and suggestions
- ‚úÖ Communication practice

### Example Usage:
```
You type: "Hi, I want to practice for a job interview"
AI speaks: "Great! Let's start with a common question..."
You type: "I'm ready"
AI speaks: "Tell me about yourself and your experience..."
```

## The Only Difference
- ‚ùå You can't speak (microphone blocked)
- ‚úÖ You type instead
- ‚úÖ AI still speaks back to you
- ‚úÖ Everything else works the same

## Why Text Input is Actually Good
1. **More Accurate**: No speech recognition errors
2. **Always Works**: No network dependency
3. **Quieter**: Can practice anywhere
4. **Faster**: Type faster than speak
5. **Better for Learning**: See your text, hear AI's response

## Alternative Solutions (If You Really Need Voice)

### Option 1: Use Different Network
- Try mobile hotspot
- Try different WiFi
- Try at different location

### Option 2: Use VPN
- Connect to VPN
- Try microphone again
- VPN might bypass restrictions

### Option 3: Use Different Computer

### Option 4: Wait for Google

- Usually temporary

## Recommendation
