# User Data Isolation Fix

## Problem
When a new user signed up, they could see data from other users because the API endpoints weren't filtering data by the authenticated user.

## Solution
Implemented proper user authentication and data isolation:

### Backend Changes

1. **Created Authentication Dependency** (`app/dependencies.py`):
   - `get_current_user()` - Extracts and validates auth token
   - `get_current_student_id()` - Gets student_id for authenticated user
   - Automatically rejects requests without valid tokens

2. **Updated All API Endpoints**:
   - **Questions API** (`app/api/question.py`):
     - Now requires authentication
     - Automatically uses logged-in user's student_id
     - Data saved only for that user
   
   - **Quiz API** (`app/api/quiz.py`):
     - Requires authentication for all operations
     - Quiz generation linked to user
     - Quiz submissions linked to user
     - History shows only user's quizzes
   
   - **Notes API** (`app/api/notes.py`):
     - Requires authentication
     - Notes linked to authenticated user
     - History filtered by user
   
   - **Profile API** (`app/api/profile.py`):
     - Get/update/delete only user's own profile
     - Stats show only user's data

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated API Client** (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`):
   - Automatically adds auth token to all requests
   - Redirects to login on 401 (unauthorized)
   - Token stored in localStorage

2. **Updated Hooks**:
   - `useProfile` - No longer needs student_id parameter
   - `useQuiz` - Removed student_id from submission
   - All hooks now rely on backend auth

## How It Works

### Request Flow
```
1. User logs in → Token stored in localStorage
2. User makes request → Token added to Authorization header
3. Backend validates token → Gets user_id
4. Backend gets student_id from user → Filters data
5. Returns only user's data
```

### Data Isolation
- Each user only sees their own:
  - Questions asked
  - Quizzes taken
  - Notes generated
  - Profile information
  - Statistics

## Testing

### Test Data Isolation
1. Create User A and ask a question
2. Logout
3. Create User B
4. User B should NOT see User A's question
5. User B's data should be empty

### Test Authentication
1. Logout
2. Try to access /question
3. Should redirect to login
4. Login and try again
5. Should work

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `app/dependencies.py` (NEW)
- `app/api/question.py`
- `app/api/quiz.py`
- `app/api/notes.py`
- `app/api/profile.py`

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProfile.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useQuiz.ts`

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- Old data without user association will not be visible
- Users need to create new data after logging in
- Consider running a migration script if you need to preserve old data

### Database
- No schema changes required
- Existing tables already have student_id foreign keys
- Data is properly linked through user → student relationship

## Security Improvements

1. **Token-Based Auth**: All requests require valid token
2. **Automatic Filtering**: Backend enforces data isolation
3. **No Client-Side IDs**: Frontend can't manipulate student_id
4. **Session Management**: Invalid tokens redirect to login
5. **User Verification**: Every request validates user exists and is active

## API Changes

### Before
```typescript
// Frontend had to pass student_id
POST /api/ask { question: "...", student_id: 1 }
GET /api/profile/1
```

### After
```typescript
// Backend gets student_id from auth token
POST /api/ask { question: "..." }
GET /api/profile
// Authorization: Bearer <token> header added automatically
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" error
- Check if user is logged in
- Verify token in localStorage
- Try logging out and back in

### Seeing no data after login
- This is correct! New users start with empty data
- Old data from before auth was not linked to users

### 401 errors
- Token expired or invalid
- User will be redirected to login automatically

## Next Steps

1. ✅ User data is now isolated
2. ✅ Authentication required for all operations
3. ✅ Automatic token management
4. Consider: Token expiration and refresh
5. Consider: Remember me functionality
6. Consider: Session timeout warnings

**Your data is now secure and properly isolated per user!**
