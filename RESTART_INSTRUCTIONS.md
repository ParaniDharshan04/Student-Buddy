In a new terminal:
```bash
python test_gemini.py
```

```
âœ… Success!
Response: 2 + 2 = 4
```

### Step 4: Test in Browser

## If Something Still Doesn't Work

### Check Backend Logs
Look at the terminal where backend is running for error messages.

### Common Issues

**"API key not valid"**
- Get a new API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Update `.env` file with new key (no quotes!)
- Restart backend

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Free tier: 15 requests per minute
- Wait 60 seconds and try again

**"Model not found"**
- Make sure you're using `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Check `app/config.py` has correct model name

**Frontend shows error**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Make sure backend is running on port 8000
- Check CORS settings

### Still Having Issues?

1. Check your API key is valid:
   ```bash
   python -c "from app.config import settings; print('Key length:', len(settings.GEMINI_API_KEY))"
   ```
   Should show: `Key length: 39`

2. Test Gemini directly:
   ```bash
   python test_gemini.py
   ```

3. Check backend is running:
   - Visit http://localhost:8000/health
   - Should show: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

4. Check frontend is running:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Should show the app

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Start backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Test Gemini API
python test_gemini.py

# Check API key
python -c "from app.config import settings; print(settings.GEMINI_API_KEY[:10])"
```
