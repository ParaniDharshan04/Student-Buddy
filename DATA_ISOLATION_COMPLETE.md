# âœ… Data Isolation - COMPLETE

## Problem Fixed
New users were seeing data from other users because the API wasn't filtering by authenticated user.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Authentication
- Created `app/dependencies.py` with authentication helpers
- All API endpoints now require valid auth token
- Data automatically filtered by logged-in user's student_id

### 2. API Updates
All endpoints updated to use authenticated user:
- âœ… Questions API - Only user's questions
- âœ… Quiz API - Only user's quizzes and attempts
- âœ… Notes API - Only user's notes
- âœ… Profile API - Only user's profile

### 3. Frontend Updates
- API client automatically adds auth token to requests
- Hooks updated to work with new endpoints
- Auto-redirect to login on unauthorized access

## How to Test

### Test 1: Data Isolation
```bash
1. Start backend: start_backend.bat
2. Start frontend: cd frontend && npm run dev
3. Create User A (signup)
4. Ask a question as User A
5. Logout
6. Create User B (signup)
7. User B should see NO data (empty state)
8. Ask a question as User B
9. User B should only see their own question
```

### Test 2: Authentication Required
```bash
1. Logout
2. Try to access http://localhost:3000/question
3. Should redirect to /login
4. Login and access again
5. Should work
```

## What Changed

### Backend Files
- `app/dependencies.py` - NEW (authentication helpers)
- `app/api/question.py` - Uses authenticated user
- `app/api/quiz.py` - Uses authenticated user
- `app/api/notes.py` - Uses authenticated user
- `app/api/profile.py` - Uses authenticated user

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Adds auth token automatically
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProfile.ts` - Updated endpoints
- `frontend/src/hooks/useQuiz.ts` - Removed student_id param

## API Changes

### Before (Insecure)
```typescript
// Anyone could access any user's data
GET /api/profile/1
GET /api/profile/2
POST /api/ask { question: "...", student_id: 1 }
```

### After (Secure)
```typescript
// Only authenticated user's data
GET /api/profile  // Returns current user's profile
POST /api/ask { question: "..." }  // Saves to current user
// Authorization: Bearer <token> required
```

## Security Features

1. **Token Required**: All requests need valid auth token
2. **Auto Filtering**: Backend enforces data isolation
3. **No ID Manipulation**: Frontend can't access other users' data
4. **Session Management**: Invalid tokens redirect to login
5. **User Verification**: Every request validates user

## Database

No schema changes needed:
- Users table already exists
- Student profiles linked to users
- All data properly associated

## Current Status

âœ… **WORKING**
- User authentication
- Data isolation per user
- Automatic token management
- Protected routes
- Secure API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check for indentation errors (fixed)
- Run: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

### "Not authenticated" errors
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check token in localStorage
- Try logout and login again

### Seeing no data
- This is correct for new users!
- Each user starts with empty data
- Create new questions/quizzes/notes

### 401 Unauthorized
- Token expired or invalid
- Will auto-redirect to login
- Login again to continue

## Next Steps

Your app is now secure with proper data isolation:
1. âœ… Each user has their own data
2. âœ… No cross-user data leakage
3. âœ… Authentication required
4. âœ… Automatic token management

**Test it now:**
1. Create multiple user accounts
2. Add data to each account
3. Verify each user only sees their own data

**Your Student Learning Buddy is now secure and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰**
