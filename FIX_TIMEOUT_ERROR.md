# Fixed: Timeout Error (30000ms exceeded)

## What Was the Problem?

The timeout error occurred because:
- Large documents take too long to process (>30 seconds)
- The API timeout was set to 30 seconds
- Gemini API needs more time for long content

## What I Fixed:

### 1. Increased Timeouts âœ…
- **Frontend API timeout**: 30s â†’ **60 seconds**
- **Backend config timeout**: 30s â†’ **60 seconds**

### 2. Reduced Content Limits âœ…
- **Notes summarization**: Limited to **8000 characters** (~1600 words)
- **Automatic truncation**: Content is cut to safe length
- **Warning message**: Shows when content will be truncated

### 3. Better Error Messages âœ…
- Clear timeout error explanation
- Helpful suggestions for users
- Distinguishes between timeout and quota errors

## How to Apply the Fix:

### 1. Restart Frontend
```bash
# In frontend terminal, press Ctrl+C
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Restart Backend
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
start_backend.bat
```

## Now You Can:

âœ… Summarize documents up to **8000 characters** (~1600 words)
âœ… Process takes up to 60 seconds (no timeout)
âœ… See warning if content is too long
âœ… Get helpful error messages

## Content Limits to Avoid Timeouts:

| Feature | Max Characters | Max Words | Max Pages |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Quiz    | 4,000         | ~800      | 2-3       |
| Notes   | 8,000         | ~1,600    | 4-5       |

## Best Practices:

### For Large Documents:
1. **Extract key sections** - Don't upload entire textbooks
2. **Use important chapters** - Focus on what you need
3. **Break into chunks** - Process one chapter at a time

### For Best Results:
- âœ… Upload 1-5 page documents
- âœ… Paste only relevant sections
- âœ… Use clear, well-formatted text
- âœ… Wait for processing (can take 30-60 seconds)

## If You Still Get Timeouts:

1. **Use smaller content** - Under 5 pages
2. **Paste text instead** - Copy only important parts
3. **Try again** - Sometimes API is slow
4. **Wait between requests** - Don't spam the button

## Test It:

1. Upload a 2-3 page PDF
2. Click "Summarize Notes"
3. Wait up to 60 seconds
4. Should work without timeout!

Everything is optimized now! ðŸŽ‰
